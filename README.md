Using assemblies in Eplan-Script (Demo)
=======================================
Sometimes scripting with Eplan Electric P8 becomes a bit frustrating because of limited usable libraries and handling a lot of code and classes in a single file. The smart developers from <a href= http://ww3.cad.de/foren/ubb/Forum467/HTML/008680.shtml >CAE-Consulting</a>  are using the class "System.Reflection.Assembly" to instantiate classes from dll-files and execute their methods. 
The detailed usage of this class and a easy example is also well described <a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.reflection.assembly(v=vs.110).aspx>here</a>. 
This project was my first try with a simple WPF window. But I think (except for the api licensed libs from Eplan) the options are nearly unlimited. I really think this is a big thing and I'm very excited about which awesome tools the eplan community will create with this technique. I hope that Eplan wonâ€™t block this technique in upcoming versions!
